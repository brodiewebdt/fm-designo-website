## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

### What I learned

I wrote about half of this over a year ago, but because of family issues, I had to put it aside. I've learned a lot since then and gave me a chance to refactor the code with updated programming knowledge. This was the largest project I worked on to date.

### Continued development

I was able to use a template for the three services pages, which helped the development. I would like to learn more about using templates and how to use them effectively. I also need to work on separating the CSS into smaller files.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) - His videos and content were a big help in learning how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox. I would recommend his videos and courses to anyone learning CSS.
- [Kevin Powell Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell)
- [John Smilga](https://johnsmilga.com/) His and Kevin's videos on mobile menuswere a big help learning how to code mobile menus.
